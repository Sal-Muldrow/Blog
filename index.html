										<p style="text-align: left;">Hi! I'm Salvatore. I'm 15 and really like working with technology. I love developing software. Web apps with node.js are my favorite, but I also tinker around with python, C++, encryption, Unity, databases, and hardware. Technology isn't the only thing I do. Besides being a student, I also enjoy food, travel, fashion, and skateboarding.</p>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/IMG_0955.JPG" alt=""></span>
								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p style="text-align: left;">I had been building regular desktop video games for a while but decided to set things up, and build an IOS game. Throwback to whenever it was last year, I built a fun little platformer game that was mobile friendly. I tested it on android and it worked great. It was time to port it to IOS...but you need a Mac to build to IOS. So I started to look into my options:<br>
								1. Build a Hackintosh (what my next post is about) <br>
								2. Figure out how to get OS X working in a virtual machine<br>
								3. Buy a Mac :( <br>
								I decided option 3 might be the best. I decided on a budget of $200, and started looking. I ended up finding a used 2010 Mac mini with some nvidia gpu, an Intel Core Duo, and 2gb of ram. I was very excited since it was my first Apple computer that wasn't a phone. For something that came out 7 years ago I was shocked for how good of condition it was in, but I guess it had just sat on somebodies desk. Also, I guess not everybody defaces their devices with stickers like I do. I finally got home and plugged it in...success! it booted...into some old old version of Mac OS that coudln't be directly updated into Sierra since it was so old. After that was solved, and Sierra was installed I was in business.
								<h2> Slow Business</h2>
								<p style="text-align: left;">
								Things were slow. The 2gb of ram barely kept up. I could barely use it. Time to break out the secret weapon. I replaced the 2gb with 4gb of ram from an old laptop. Now we were cooking. I could have multiple applications open, watch videos, have multiple chrome tabs (woah), anything but use unity. Which was the whole point, but that isn't the point of this post. The point of this post is to see if you can actually develop ANYTHING.
								</p>
								<h2> Conclusion</h2>
								While I wasn't able to work with Unity or Xcode, preformance was great for other applications like Sublime Text. In conclusion, if you are somebody who wants a small form factor PC, the OS X experience, and you only runs low resource applications, this is a perfect option for you.
